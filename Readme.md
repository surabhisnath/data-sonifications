Sonification is the use of nonspeech audio to convey information. More specifically, sonification is the transformation of data relations into perceived relations in an acoustic signal for the purposes of facilitating communication or interpretation.

Any technique that uses data as input, and generates (eventually only in response to additional excitation or triggering) sound signals may be called sonification, if and only if

(A) the sound reflects properties / relations in the input data.
(B) the transformation is completely systematic. This means that there is a precise definition of how interactions and data cause the sound to change.
(C) the sonification is reproducible: given the same data and identical interactions/triggers the resulting sound has to be structurally identical.
(D) the system can intentionally be used with different data, and also be used in repetition with the same data.
